## Convolutional Neural Networks
### Project 1 : Fashion Image Classification
> Classifys images based on type of apparel, footwear, accesory into 10 possible output neurons
- 60,000 training images , - 10,000 test images
- Data Flattening
- Activation Functions: ReLU / Softmax
- 10 epochs
- 90% accuracy achieved on unseen data  
### Project 2 : IMBD Review Text Classification (Positive/Negative)
> Classify IMBD movie review as either positive or negative
- 30,000 training images, 30,000 test images
